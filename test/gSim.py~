"""In this python module we try to simulate the behaviour of free moving bodies interacting only through gravitational force. It is composed by:
  -Class body, that simply stores information regarding a specific body with mass
  -Functions that calculate the next position of a list(body1,body2,...) given their current status

  G is the gravitational constant
